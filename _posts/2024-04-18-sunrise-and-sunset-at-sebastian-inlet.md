I made it to Sebastian Inlet for both sunrise and sunset today.  When I pulled in at sunrise, I saw some fishermen getting out of their truck and spraying on the bug spray, and I started to get a little worried.  Turns out, I had good reason to be worried, the bugs were vicious and feasted on my legs.  But I did manage to get a couple good sunrise pics and a beautiful sunset picture, as the sun settled down over Indian River.
