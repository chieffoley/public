On Friday we went to Thunder Cove beach, and while there I saw this yellow butterfly, so I took about a hundred pictures of her trying to get her in focus, and these three are the ones that came out good.  She was very cooperative, just stayed near me and kept taking off and landing right around me so I could get a picture.
