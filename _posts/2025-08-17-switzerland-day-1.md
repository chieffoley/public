# 2025 Switzerland - Sunday - Travel-Time

We met at Paul's house high noon on Sunday August 24th 2025, bright-eyed and bushy tailed, completely unaware of the shape we would be in 20 hours later when we would arrive at our new, temporary home in Wengen, Switzerland. This harrowing journey, which would have taken weeks or months in centuries past, would be completed in just 20 hours, after which we would be exhausted, cranky, and completely discombobulated, however, once we saw the beauty of Switzerland we would forget all about the journey.

We took the Blue Apple Bus from Mansfield Train Station to Logan Airport, the first leg of a many-legged journey, arriving at Logan at about 2:15, where we would wait for 2 and a half hours before boarding our flight. While at the airport, we made sure to get some food, filling our bellies because the internet told us there would be no meal on the plane, although some of us were skeptical of this strange source called "the internet". After all, we were flying Swiss Air, and I remember from my youth that Swiss Air was the best airline of them all, how could they let us starve for the seven hour flight?

The plane pulled back from the gate at 5:05, but there was some wait for the runway and we took off late, about 6 pm ET, bound for Zurich, Switzerland where we would arrive almost 7 hours later, at about 6:40 am Swiss time. We flew aboard a massive A330-300.

Once the plane levelled off, the Swiss efficiency kicked in and the food and goodies started arriving at our seats, delivered by a young blond-haired, blue-eyed Swiss-Miss. First, we got a refreshing towellete and a bottle of water. Once they served that to everyone, it was quickly followed by a dish of almonds. We had barely polished that off when the stewardess came by with more drink choices. The came a full dinner. The service was rapid-paced and the food seemed endless. For dinner, they had a pasta dish or a chicken dish. By the time I had finished dinner, I couldn't eat another bite. They came around again with more drink choices. After that it was bedtime, and a few hours later, with the flight nearing its end, they woke us and served up another round of drinks and a breakfast roll, with cream cheese and jam. They finished off the flight by giving everyone a piece of Swiss chocolate! One thing I learned, always trust in Swiss Air to deliver, and never trust this new-fangled internet thing.

Squeakie enjoyed the flight. He could just stare out that window for hours.
