Our waitress Saturday night recommended that we check out Point Prim and see the light house there, so on Sunday late afternoon we made the drive over there.  This is a beautiful area, and the lighting and sky was cooperating with my photography allowing me to get some of the best shots of the trip.  I snapped some photos of the light house, and then turned my attention to the intertidal zone which stretched on for quite a bit and provided a lot of interest for photos.

After getting the above pics of the intertidal zone, it started drizzling, but this scenery was too good for me to pack it in just yet, so I stuck it out for 10 minutes or so until the rain cloud passed.  I then turned my attention back to the light house.  There was a mom, dad, and son nearby at the picnic table, and the dad alerted me to the rainbow that was forming, and so I moved in to get a good composition, and then he pointed out it was a double rainbow!  How fortunate for me.

After taking that picture I noticed that the shadow of the light house was falling across the intertidal zone, and figured if I walked out to the end of that shadow I could get the sun coming through the lighthouse window, mimicking what it would be like if the light house were lit up.  I snapped the following two photos, which I think are my favorite of the trip.

On the way home from Point Prim, I just had to take advantage of the glorious light cast by the sun as it sank towards the western horizon.

We talked to the family there that pointed out the rainbow to me for a while.  They were staying at a family home up the street (the one with a big Canadian flag hanging between two trees), and the father had grown up in the area.  When he was a kid the light house was always open and anyone could climb up to the top and there was even a working air horn up there that would echo across the bay that anyone could blow whenever they wanted.  Of course, nowadays, there is no horn and they charge you money to go inside the light house.
