I was testing out my new Sigma 150-600 mm zoom lens, and I got a good shot of the moon - its incredible to get that detail on the moon picture.  Then I sat and waited for a bird to fly in front of the moon and get a picture of it.  After a half hour, this was the best I could do.  Probably should have had the shutter closed more to get the moon a little in focus.
